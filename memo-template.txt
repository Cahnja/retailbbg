## Investment Thesis
Synthesize the key reason or reasons to buy the stock in a short overview. Stylistically, this should be very aggressively written (short sentences, not verbose, straight to the point).
- Start with a bold statement

## History & Business Overview
- When was the company founded and how has it evolved since then to get us to where we are today?
- What are the key products that the company sells?
- What are the company's business segments and what % of revenue does each represent?
- This section should be 6-7 detailed paragraphs covering:
  - Founding story and early history
  - Major pivots, acquisitions, or transformations over time
  - Current business segments and revenue breakdown
  - Key products/services in each segment with specific details
- Include a "**Key Insight:** [insight text]" callout with an important fact or metric

## Thesis Details
This is the MOST IMPORTANT and LONGEST section - it should be 40-50% of the entire memo.
- Go into detail on the key reasons to buy the stock
- Divide into 4-5 numbered sub-sections (e.g., "### 1. First Reason", "### 2. Second Reason")
- Each sub-section should be 3-4 substantial paragraphs with:
  - Specific facts, numbers, and evidence
  - Customer names, market sizes, growth rates
  - Why this matters for the stock

## Key Customers & Partnerships
- Who are the company's most important customers?
- What % of revenue do top customers represent?

  Description of relationship, % of revenue, contract details, strategic importance. 2-3 sentences.

## Competitive Landscape

  **2. Another Competitor**
  Description...

## Differentiation
What makes the company's products differentiated vs. the competition?

## Key Debates
This should be a ROBUST section with 4-5 numbered debates that investors are actively discussing.
- Use the earnings Q&A to identify what analysts are questioning
- IMPORTANT: Each debate title MUST be a question that ENDS WITH A QUESTION MARK (?) - do NOT omit it (e.g., "Can the company maintain 25% margins as competition increases?")
- Bull Case: 4-5 sentences with specific numbers, metrics, and evidence
- Bear Case: 4-5 sentences with specific numbers, metrics, and evidence
- Format each as: ### 1. [Debate Question]

## Key Risks
What are the biggest risks going forward? Use the Risk Factors section from the 10-K to help lay out some of the key risks.
- Format each risk as: "**1. Risk Name:** Description of the risk and why it matters"
- Include 4-5 key risks, each as a separate paragraph
- Don't just regurgitate the 10K - re-write each risk in your own words

## Management Quality
- Who is the CEO and how long has he/she been at the company?
- What is their track record? Have they executed well?
- Any notable achievements or missteps?
- What is the CEO's history (prior work experience)

## Valuation
- State whether the stock is expensive or cheap relative to peers
- Compare current P/E, EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA to peer group averages
- Be objective - do NOT justify the valuation ("premium is warranted because...")
