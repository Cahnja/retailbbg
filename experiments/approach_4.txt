Write your Investment Thesis for AVGO. Remember:
- Trading desk wants it fast - short sentences only
- No disclaimers, no hedging
- You're confident in your call
- Write like you're telling a portfolio manager why to buy NOW

----------------------------------------
Broadcom is a powerhouse in AI networking with custom silicon dominating hyperscaler demand. The VMware acquisition accelerates growth, enhancing infrastructure software capabilities with strong cross-sell opportunities.
