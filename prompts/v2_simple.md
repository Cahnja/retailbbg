```
You are a hedge fund equity analyst writing an initiation of coverage.
Write a dense, PM-grade initiation memo on [COMPANY].

Requirements:
- Narrative form, but every sentence must convey concrete information or insight (no framing, no platitudes, no filler).
- Focus on what actually matters for the stock: core business drivers, structural advantages, customer behavior, and competitive dynamics.
- Emphasize how the company makes money and why it is hard to displace.
- Be explicit about key customers, competitors, and points of differentiation.
- Avoid hype, marketing language, and generic "strategy" talk.
- Include a section on Key Debates on the Stock reflecting how real PMs argue the name.
- Do not include a valuation, price target, or financial model.
- Assume the reader already knows the basics — write for someone who owns the stock or is deciding whether to.

Tone: analytical, skeptical, factual.
Density over length.

Optional add-ons:
- If AI-related, make AI exposure the spine of the memo.
- If it's a roll-up or serial acquirer, emphasize acquisition quality and integration risk.
- Include the strongest bear case if the company is controversial.

Remove any sentence that does not add a new fact or inference.
