## What Broadcom Does in AI

Broadcom is the leading merchant partner for custom AI accelerators (ASICs) designed and deployed by hyperscalers. These chips are co-designed with customers to run specific training and inference workloads at scale, optimizing for power efficiency, cost per compute, and tight integration with data center infrastructure. Unlike GPUs, these ASICs eliminate excess programmability and scale economically once volumes reach hyperscale levels.

Broadcom co-designed Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) starting with TPU v1 and continuing through multiple generations. This was the first large-scale, production deployment of custom AI silicon and remains the most mature non-GPU AI accelerator platform in operation. The TPU program established Broadcom as the default external partner for hyperscalers seeking to internalize AI compute.

Since Google, Broadcom has expanded this model across additional hyperscalers. Industry disclosures, supply-chain data, and customer behavior point to active custom AI silicon programs with Google, Meta, ByteDance, and Apple, among others. These engagements are multi-year and multi-generation. Once deployed, switching vendors requires re-architecting software stacks, retraining models, and redesigning data center infrastructure, creating very high switching costs.

Broadcom's role extends beyond logic design. It delivers full silicon platforms, including high-speed SerDes, advanced packaging, memory interfaces, power optimization, and co-optimized networking. This breadth reduces execution risk for customers and materially limits the number of viable competitors.

## Why Hyperscalers Are Moving to Custom AI Silicon

At scale, AI workloads are dominated by a narrow set of operations. GPUs carry flexibility that hyperscalers do not fully utilize but still pay for in power consumption and unit cost. Custom ASICs can deliver materially better performance per watt and cost per inference once volumes justify development.

As AI moves from experimentation to persistent production workloads, these economics become decisive. Hyperscalers with sustained demand benefit from internal silicon roadmaps, while GPUs remain optimal for flexibility, smaller-scale deployments, and rapidly evolving workloads. Broadcom is the primary merchant enabler of this shift.

## Demand Visibility and Scale

Broadcom serves a limited number of AI customers with long-term capacity commitments extending multiple years forward. Management has described AI demand as infrastructure build-out rather than cyclical spending, with visibility measured in tens of billions of dollars of backlog.

This level of forward visibility is rare in semiconductors and reflects the planning horizons associated with hyperscale data center construction and AI platform deployment. AI-related revenue is growing materially faster than the rest of Broadcom's semiconductor portfolio and represents a disproportionate share of incremental growth.

## Networking: The Binding Constraint in AI Scaling

Broadcom is the dominant supplier of Ethernet switching silicon inside hyperscale data centers. Its switches connect AI accelerators across large clusters, enabling distributed training and inference at scale.

As clusters grow from thousands to tens of thousands of accelerators, networking becomes a primary constraint. Model parallelism and distributed workloads drive exponential increases in east-west traffic. Regardless of whether compute is powered by GPUs or custom ASICs, traffic flows through Broadcom networking silicon.

This gives Broadcom dual exposure: it benefits both from overall AI compute growth and from the shift toward internal accelerators.

## Competitive Positioning

In custom AI silicon, Broadcom has very few credible peers.

**Marvell** is the most frequently cited alternative but is structurally weaker. Its AI business is overwhelmingly concentrated in a single customer: Amazon (AWS), supporting internal accelerators such as Trainium and Inferentia. AWS is a price-setter rather than a collaborative partner, resulting in lower-margin, narrower-scope engagements. Marvell lacks Broadcom's depth in end-to-end platforms, particularly across networking, advanced packaging, and system-level co-design. Its AI revenue remains highly customer-concentrated and more easily displaced.

**MediaTek** operates primarily in cost-optimized SoCs and consumer-scale silicon. While capable in integration and volume manufacturing, it lacks relevance in high-performance AI training and large-scale data center inference and does not meaningfully compete in hyperscale AI platforms or networking.

Beyond these names, competition thins rapidly. Sustaining custom AI silicon programs at hyperscale requires advanced process expertise, high-speed I/O, packaging, software co-design, and the balance sheet to support multi-generation commitments. Hyperscalers rarely dual-source early-stage AI ASICs, reinforcing concentration once a design enters production.

In networking, Broadcom remains the clear leader in high-end Ethernet switching for AI data centers. Ethernet's cost structure, ecosystem maturity, and software compatibility continue to favor Broadcom as clusters scale.

## Key Debates on the Stock

**1. Will Custom ASICs Meaningfully Displace GPUs?**
The debate is not full displacement but incremental adoption. Even partial migration of hyperscale workloads represents very large dollar volumes. Broadcom does not need GPUs to lose relevance to win.

**2. How Concentrated Is AI Revenue?**
AI revenue is driven by a small number of hyperscalers. Bulls argue this increases visibility and switching costs. Bears worry about negotiating leverage. In practice, internal silicon programs tend to persist once deployed.

**3. Does Networking Growth Fully Offset Compute Volatility?**
AI networking demand scales with cluster size, not accelerator vendor. As long as AI compute grows, Broadcom's networking exposure provides a stabilizing second engine.

**4. Is VMware a Distraction or a Stabilizer?**
VMware is not an AI driver. It matters for valuation and cash flow stability, but the AI thesis stands independently.

**5. Is Broadcom Fully Priced?**
Broadcom lacks the headline visibility of GPU-centric AI names. The debate is whether the durability and visibility of its AI revenue are fully reflected in expectations.
