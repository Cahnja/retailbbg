# Memo Grading Methodology

## Score Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | PM-ready. Dense, accurate, actionable. Could inform a position. |
| 7-8 | Strong. Right thesis, good specifics, minor gaps. |
| 5-6 | Mediocre. Correct thesis but shallow or missing key insights. |
| 3-4 | Weak. Partially correct but significant gaps or fluff. |
| 1-2 | Useless. Wrong thesis, wrong framing, or filled with generic language. Wouldn't help a PM. |

## Hard Rules

1. **Wrong core thesis → capped at 3**
   - If the memo doesn't identify what actually drives the stock, it's worthless regardless of writing quality

2. **Filler/marketing language → severe penalty**
   - Each generic phrase ("global technology leader", "unprecedented demand", "cutting-edge") signals the writer doesn't understand the business
   - Density is the #1 quality — every sentence must teach something non-obvious

3. **Wrong competitors → reveals fundamental misunderstanding**
   - Must identify the actual competitive dynamics, not just name big companies in adjacent spaces

## What Matters Most (in order)

1. **Insight density** — Every sentence teaches something non-obvious
2. **Accuracy** — Getting the facts and framing right
3. **Relevance** — Focusing on what actually drives the stock
4. **Tone/style** — Reading like a real PM wrote it

## Reference Scores

- `AVGO_reference.md` — **8.5/10** (strong, dense, right thesis, light on numbers)
- `AVGO_vCurrent.md` — **2/10** (wrong thesis, wrong competitors, filler language)
